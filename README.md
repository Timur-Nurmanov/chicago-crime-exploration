# Exploration of Chicago crime dataset

Exploration of dataset that contains the history of crime rate in Chicago, IL from 2001 to today.

The dataset contains **22 columns** and **7,633,243 entries**. Because of this huge volume of data, I found it to be interesting and challenging to explore.

I discovered this dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chicago/chicago-crime), however *csv* file can be downloaded from [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2).

## Questions to answer:

-   Which year was the most/least dangerous?

-   Which police district tends to perform most arrests?

-   Which community area has the highest crime rate?

-   Is there are correlation between community area and police district?
